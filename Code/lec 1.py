#! Thelist:     a sequence of related data
#!Thetuple:     a list whose elements may not be modified
#!1- Adictionary: a list of values that are accessed through their associated keys.
# print("waleed")

#!2- Tuple unpacking
# t = 1 , 'A' , [1,2,3]
# var , c , lst = t
# print(var,c,lst)

#!3- Converting a tupleto a list
# newLst = list(t)
# print(type(newLst))

#!4-  Converting a listto a tupleusing the tuplefunction
# tup = tuple(newLst)
# print(tup)

#!5- zip function pairs up elements from two different sequences.
# ?  If one of the sequences is shorter than
# ?  the other, the zip function stops at the
# ?  shorter sequence and ignores the
# ?  remainder of the longer sequence
